## Tokyo's Traffic Rules for Bicycles

> [!NOTE] 
>From November 2024, Tokyo began to strictly regulate bicycles.
> Here are the regulations for bicycles in Tokyo [Bicycle Traffic Rules Metropolitan Police Department](https://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/kotsu/jikoboshi/bicycle/menu/rule.html)

According to the aforementioned Tokyo bicycle traffic regulations, bicycles are not allowed on sidewalks and can only be ridden on the far left of the road, but most roads in Tokyo do not have dedicated bicycle lanes.

There is a bicycle icon painted on the side of the car lane, which is the bicycle lane. According to the regulations, you should ride on the far left of the road, which leads to a problem where cars often pass by you, and I often worry about being hit by cars on the road.

However, compared to being hit, I am more worried about hitting the elderly in Japan. If you hit a Japanese person, it's really unaffordable, so I basically never ride on the sidewalk if I can ride on the road.
> [!TIP] 
> Many people ride bicycles on the sidewalk in Tokyo, especially mothers with children.

## Tokyo's Traffic Lights

The second reason why cycling in Tokyo is uncomfortable is the lack of cycling paths, followed by Tokyo's traffic lights.

There are really many traffic lights in Tokyo, and there is one every few meters. It's not fast to ride a bicycle, and it's stop-and-go, so it's not very possible to ride freely on the main roads of Tokyo.

## Where is the most comfortable place to ride a bicycle in Tokyo?

When I was in Kita-Senju, I went to the banks of the Arakawa River. The Tokyo government prepared a lot of open space on both sides of the river to prevent floods. There are roads built on this open space, and there are many people running and cycling on it.

You can ride up to the mountains of Saitama Prefecture, and if you ride down, you can ride to the sea.

Cars are not allowed on the riverside road, so you can ride very freely. I have ridden to Asaka City in Saitama Prefecture, and I have not gone further. There are also sports fields built along the river, and there are toilets next to the sports fields, so there are no problems with going to the toilet or washing your face.

But the only drawback of the riverside is the lack of street lights, which is very inconvenient for me who likes to ride at night.

Comparatively, I prefer to ride my bicycle towards the sea. I prefer the sea a bit more. Starting from Ueno, it's only a dozen kilometers to the sea, and it takes less than an hour to get to the sea.
