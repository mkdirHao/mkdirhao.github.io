## How to install from a local pkgbuild file using yay

To install a software package using a local `PKGBUILD` file with `yay`, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain the `PKGBUILD` file**: First, you need a `PKGBUILD` file, which is usually obtained from AUR or other sources. If you already have this file, ensure it is located in your local file system.

2. **Install `base-devel` and `git`**: Before starting, make sure your system has the `base-devel` and `git` packages installed, as these are necessary for building the package. You can install them with the following command:
   ```
   pacman -S --needed base-devel git
   ```

3. **Clone or download `yay`**: If you haven't installed `yay`, you can clone its repository from AUR and install it. Use the following commands:
   ```
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
   cd yay
   makepkg -si
   ```
   This will build and install `yay`. After installation, you can verify that `yay` has been successfully installed by running `yay --version`.

4. **Use `yay` to install a local `PKGBUILD`**: Once you have the `PKGBUILD` file and `yay`, you can use `yay` to install the local `PKGBUILD`. Assuming your `PKGBUILD` file is in a certain directory, you can use the following command:
   ```
   yay -Bi <directory>
   ```
   Here `<directory>` is the path to the directory containing your `PKGBUILD` file. The `-Bi` option tells `yay` to install dependencies and build the local `PKGBUILD`.

5. **Confirm the installation**: After the build is complete, `yay` will prompt you to confirm the installation. Follow the instructions on the screen, usually by pressing `Y` to confirm.

6. **Verify the installation**: After the installation is complete, you can use `yay` to verify whether the package has been successfully installed, or use `pacman` to query the list of installed packages.

The above steps provide a basic guide on how to install packages using a local `PKGBUILD` file with `yay`. Please ensure you follow all security practices, as building packages from AUR or other unofficial sources may pose security risks.
