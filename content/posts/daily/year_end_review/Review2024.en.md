My Year-End Summary for 2024
<!--more-->

## Work/Career Development

This year, I had no work at all, and there was no progress in my career. After coming to Japan, I didn't make any efforts in job hunting.

## Health and Fitness

I've been intermittently trying to lose weight this year, but with little success.

## Finances

My personal finances this year have been a bit tight, on the brink of personal bankruptcy.

## Emotional Aspect

I broke up with Jia Da Pang, and although there have been other romantic interests, I still don't want to start a new relationship.

## Friendship

I met quite a few interesting people at the language school and in the shared house.

## Family Relationships

With the passing of my grandparents and the worsening situation with my family, I plan to continue cutting ties with my hometown.

## Interesting Things from the Past Year

1. In February, I traveled to Hong Kong to watch the fireworks and then met up with Lu Yiyi and Han Xinyu in Shenzhen.
1. Spending three months in Dongguan was quite enjoyable.
1. In May, Feng Xiangbo got married, and I went back to Luoyang.
1. I came to Japan in June, and my first experience here felt like a dream.
1. To experience the life of Japanese internet cafe refugees, I stayed in an internet cafe for a few days, which was quite an interesting experience.
1. Biking along the Arakawa River was a great experience.
1. In October, I met Miria, which was nice, even though she wasn't interested in me.
1. Then I met Jiang Yunhuan, who took me to a Japanese drinking party.
1. In December, I visited the aquarium, which was quite nice.

## Summary

Overall, there hasn't been much progress or achievement this year, but leaving China has already been a significant step in my life journey.
